## Project Ideas

#### Localization and Mapping

    1. Indoor-Outdoor seamless localization
        a. GPS
        b. LIDAR
        c. IMU
    2. Semantic SLAM
    3. ORB-SLAM
    4. Low cost localization
        a. Cheap compute
        b. Model planes localization
        c. Purely IMU or maybe with time-of-flight
    5. WiFi based localization
    6. 2.5D occupancy grid for terrain mapping


#### Control and Planning

    1. Ensemble MPC
    2. 


#### Overall stack

    1. Self parking
    2. Move box from A to B (can be indoor/outdoor) using robot bumps
    3. Something with Unity


### Current Rank:
1. Move box from A to B
2.
